QNo.45
Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a 
manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function 
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the 
Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
